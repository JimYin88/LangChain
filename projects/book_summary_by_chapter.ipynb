He finds that the ocean has a profound effect on him, and he is drawn to its power and mystery. The narrator notes that almost all men share this feeling towards the ocean, but few have the opportunity to pursue it. He explains that going to sea is his substitute for violence and conflict, as embodied in the character of Cato, who throws himself onto his sword.\n",

The narrator then explains why he prefers to go to sea as a simple sailor rather than as a passenger or officer.\n",

Additionally, he values the physical exercise and fresh air of life on board a ship over the comforts and social status associated with being an officer. The narrator's desire to go on a whaling voyage is driven by his fascination with the ocean and its creatures, particularly the great whale.\n",

However, he discovers that the packet for Nantucket has already sailed and he must wait until Monday. Feeling disappointed, the narrator sets out to find temporary lodgings. He explores the town's dreary streets, passing by several establishments with ominous names, including \"The Crossed Harpoons\" and \"The Sword-Fish Inn.\" Eventually, he comes across a small, dilapidated building called \"The Spouter-Inn,\" which appears to be the cheapest option in the area. The narrator enters the inn, where he is greeted by a dim light and an interior that resembles a black church. Despite feeling uneasy about his surroundings, he decides to stay at \"The Spouter\" for cheap lodgings and a cup of pea coffee, eager to start his whaling journey as soon as possible.\n"
